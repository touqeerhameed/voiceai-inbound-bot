   - All backend services required before WordPress Plugin

2. **Configuration**
   - Update .env files with actual API keys and secrets
   - Configure database connections properly
   - Set up Redis clustering for production

3. **Security**
   - Never commit API keys or secrets to git
   - Use proper authentication for all endpoints
   - Implement rate limiting and input validation

## 🚀 **Ready to Start Implementation**
